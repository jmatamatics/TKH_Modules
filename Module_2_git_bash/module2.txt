What is Git and how is it different from Github?
Git manages your source code history. It is a version control system. Github is a remote hosting of git repositories. It is a platform used to save code, track its versions, and collaborate with others.

Why use the terminal?
Terminals are a direct way to speak to your computer. The terminal uses a lot less system resources than a graphic user interface(GUI). More so, the use of terminals only requires a keyboard while a GUI requires a keyboard and mouse. Lastly, they keep a track record of what you done making it possible to review your actions. 


Explain 3 benefits of version control in your own words
1.Version control allows you to keep history and track any changes you or your collaborators make. If changes made to a project caused problems to occur, developers can determine the specific cause and remove it. 
2. Version Controls allows to have backups of your work on different machines to ensure no data is lost.
3. Version Control allows you to clone projects and experiment on them. You can test new code/features before applying them to the master project.
